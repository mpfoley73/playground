# U.S. Census Analysis

This project works with the US Census API.

# API Key

The ACS page links to page to [request a key](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/api-key.html). It asks you for your organization and email. I chose Personal/Hobbiest as my organization. I submitted the form and an email arrived in a few minutes with the key. I saved the key in .Renviron and added .Renviron to .gitignore so that it is kept private.

# Cleveland Wards
